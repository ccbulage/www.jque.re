 Powered by MaxCDN

 <strong>
 Feel free to hotlink to any asset / URL listed here.
 That's what it's here for!

 If a site uses site-wide TLS/HTTPS, you can include an asset as follows

 <strong>&lt;script src=&quot;https://handpickedjquery-eiremedia.netdna-ssl.com/plugins/effects-ui/blur.js/blur.js&quot;&gt;</strong>

 If you are linking to assets using plaintext HTTP (Not recommended), please use a <i>schemeless</i> URI.
 This avoids mixed content warnings, and the browser will still load the secure HTTPS/TLS asset.
 For example:
 
 <strong>//handpickedjquery-eiremedia.netdna-ssl.com/asset.js</strong>

These are <span class=emph>examples only</span>. The full list contains URLs for every plugin in the repo:

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>When The Handpicked jQuery Plugins Repository first launched in 2011, it was a basic site with a handful of cool plugins, and not looking great in terms of design.</p>
    <p>The site constantly went down due to new demand for curated plugins, and the official <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery plugins registry</a> was famously down for the best part of a year. People needed their jQuery fix, and I was giving it to them.</p>

    <p>Use this page as a reference point for CDN URLs should you require any. We are on a dedicated MaxCDN setup so all JS is Gzipped and served from several <i>edge locations</i> from around the world for peace of mind. I have no plans to take the repo offline, so you are more than welcome to hotlink and use these assets in your webapp. There are a few solutions out there that offer such CDN services, but we are different in that we provide lots of edge case scripts you simply will not find anywhere else.</p>

    <p>The site gets increasingly lean and mean over time. The colors change, the CDN gets better, and more new fans <a href="https://github.com/enginnr/www.jque.re/archive/gh-pages.zip" target="_blank">download the repo</a> each day to experiment with the plugins.</p>
    <p>The awesome people at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN </a>are sponsoring us, and this allows the site to load much faster. Others can hotlink to scripts, and browsing the site feels much faster. All the plugins are served from <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages,</a> so the site is easier to maintain.</p>
    <p>Version 3 is the full expression of this repo as it stands now. I could not have hoped for a more gorgeous selection of plugins coded by some very talented people. Bear in mind, all this is <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/enginnr">open source, and on Github</a>.
        <p>Thanks to everybody who has shared the URL on Twitter or linked to the Repo elsewhere. It's the fans that make this Repo get smarter, better, and stronger each year. If you write jQuery plugins and feel like your plugin deserves a place here, you can use the <a href="/feedback.html">feedback form</a>, or simply <a href="http://higg.tel/" rel="nofollow">contact me.</a>
